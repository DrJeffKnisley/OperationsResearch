    "* If there were a real manufacturing scenario (= a case study), then there are several problems that would need to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How many of each type per milling machine per day? Would each machine make a mix of the two types or would we assign each machine to do nothing but one type or the other? That is, there is potentially more than one problem in this problem.   \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Employees who can make both engineering and standard shafts are likely paid more than than those who can only make standard shafts. Would a labor cost constraint change the solution to this problem? If so, we would say that it is an _active_ constraint, whereas if a labor cost constraint does not change the solution, then we would say it is a _passive_ constraint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  * What if the machines were each run 8 hours per day (32 hours total)? What if some workers that can currently only make standard shafts learn how to make engineering shafts also? That is, how _sensitive_ is our solution to changes in the constraints? \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Not all logs are the same size, so 20 thousand shafts per log is probably an average.  _That is, the real problem most certainly involves some random processes_. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Unlikely that the respective pencil factory and manufacturer would demand exactly the same number of shafts at all times. In fact, customer demand for final products likely would dictate their demand from Acme for the shafts. Thus, Acme is only one \"link\" in a _supply chain_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final answer should be a integer number of standard shafts and an integer number of engineering shafts. <i style = \"color:blue\">The need for the answers to be integers, rather than real number in general, is a very common problem that is addressed\n",
    "in many different ways.</i>\n",

    "  * __ We'll briefly look at this issue _algorithmically_, __ which is always the last resort. The algorithms that Operations Researchers rely on are very fast and accurate, but they are also incredibly sophisticated -- so much so that only the grad students at the end will explore what they are and how they work. However, once we force any of these algorithms to return integer solutions, they all become _non-polynomial time algorithms (NP). _ Unless you first solve the \\$1,000,000 Clay  Institute P versus NP millenium prize problem, this means that the time required to produce integer solutions increases exponentially with the number of variables in the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "* __Variable Definition__:  First, we define the _decision_ variables, which are the independent variables whose values must be _decided_ (colloquially -- \"solved for\"). This is very important and typically means careful choice of units, domain, type, etcetera.  It also often means using meaningful names like NUMBEROFSTANDARDSHAFTS and NUMBEROFENGINEERINGSHAFTS, although here and not infrequently later we will use typical \"math\" variable names. <br/>\n",

    "To reiterate, these variables $x$ and $y$ are called _decision variables_, in that a statement like $x = 15$ represents a _decision_ to make 15 thousand standard pencil shafts.  \n",

    "* __Identifying the Objective__: Our objective is to _maximize_ revenue, which we have called $z$.  In particular, the revenue from the sale of $x$ thousands of standard shafts is $2x$, and the revenue from the sale of $y$ thousands of engineering shafts is $3y$, so that our objective is to maximize $2x + 3y$.  However, we often write the function in equation form $z = 2x+3y $, so that our objective is to \n",

If you are uncomfortable combining the machines this way, it is by design -- in the real world, our problem could not remain so simple.  For now, however, let's press on noting that a hour per thousand for standard and 2 hours per thousand for engineering shafts means that $$x+2y \\le 30.$$  Acme won't want to make more than 15 thousand standard pencils per day, so also $x \\le 15$.  Also, the labor distribution implies that $y$ cannot exceed twice $x$, or $$ y \\le 2x.$$  Finally, __ _ and very importantly_ __ there are 2 additional constraints that occur very, very often! $$ x \\ge 0, \\quad y \\ge 0.$$\n",

A new order for 100 widgets has just been placed as a priority rush job, so it will have to be filled using overtime.

If it were a real world problem (= case study), then the first and most obvious difference is that we likely would be talking about more than 2 employees.

Moreover, seniority not only means an employee can expect more hours, but also means that an employee can pass those hours down to lower seniority personnel if they so desire.  Thus, number of hours of overtime an employee is willing to work is in reality a random variable with an unknown distribution!!

    "4. A farmer has $20$ acres on which he will plant $x$ acres of feed corn (for animals) and $y$ acres of sweet corn (for humans). It will cost \\$1,000 per acre to grow feed corn and \\$2,000 per acre to raise sweet corn; and the farmer has \\$30,000 on hand at the beginning of the growing season.  Market analysis indicates that the number of acres of sweet corn should be no greater than twice the number of acres of feed corn, but he also wants to be taken seriously as a sweet corn producer, so he desires to grow no more than 15 acres of feed corn.  In units of thousands of dollars per acre, he knows that feed corn sells for \\$2 thousands of dollars per acre, while sweet corn sells for \\$5 thousands of dollars per acre. How many acres should he plant in feed corn, and how many in sweet corn, in order to maximize the revenue from the corn?  \n",
