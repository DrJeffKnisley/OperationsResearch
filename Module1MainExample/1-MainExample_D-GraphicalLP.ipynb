It will cost \\$1,000 per acre to grow feed corn and \\$2,000 per acre to raise sweet corn; and the farmer has \\$30,000 on hand at the beginning of the growing season.  Market analysis indicates that the number of acres of sweet corn should be no greater than twice the number of acres of feed corn, but he also wants to be taken seriously as a sweet corn producer, so he desires to grow no more than 15 acres of feed corn.  In units of thousands of dollars per acre, he knows that feed corn sells for \\$2 thousands of dollars per acre, while sweet corn sells for \\$5 thousands of dollars per acre. How many acres should he plant in feed corn, and how many in sweet corn, in order to maximize the revenue from the corn?  \n",
